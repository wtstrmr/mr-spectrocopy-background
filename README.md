# mr-spectroscopy-background

A two-part fairly high-level description of MR spectroscopy (MRS) data and some basic processing activities.

### Simulated_FID_Example_Part1.ipynb

Jupyter notebook exploring MRS by generating simulated signals at different frequencies, then combining to produce simulated MRS time-series data.

### Simulated_FID_Example_Part2.ipynb

The discrete Fourier transform is appied to the simulated time-series data in Part 1 to produce spectra, both from the simulated single-frequency data and the combined data. Next, the simulated data is compared to some sample MRS data collected from a human leg. Finally, a method of estimating the transverse relaxation time from a single frequency is described.
